/**
In-place Convert BST into a Min-Heap
 Given a Binary Search Tree, convert it into a Min-Heap containing the same elements in O(n) time. Do this in-place.

 Input: Binary Search Tree
 8
 /    \
 4      12
 /  \     /  \
 2    6   10  14


 Output - Min Heap
 2
 /    \
 4        6
 /  \     /   \
 8    10  12   14
 [Or any other tree that follows Min Heap
 properties and has same keys]

 If we are allowed to use extra space, we can perform inorder traversal of the tree and store the keys in an
 auxiliary array. As weâ€™re doing inorder traversal on a BST, array will be sorted. Finally, we construct a complete
 binary tree from the sorted array. We construct the binary tree level by level and from left to right by taking next
 minimum element from sorted array. The constructed binary tree will be a min-Heap. This solution works in O(n) time,
 but is not in-place.

 How to do it in-place?
 The idea is to convert the binary search tree into a sorted linked list first. We can do this by traversing the BST
 in inorder fashion. We add nodes at the beginning of current linked list and update head of the list using pointer
 to head pointer. Since we insert at the beginning, to maintain sorted order, we first traverse the right subtree
 before the left subtree. i.e. do a reverse inorder traversal.

 Finally we convert the sorted linked list into a min-Heap by setting the left and right pointers appropriately.
 We can do this by doing a Level order traversal of the partially built Min-Heap Tree using queue and traversing
 the linked list at the same time. At every step, we take the parent node from queue, make next two nodes of linked
 list as children of the parent node, and enqueue the next two nodes to queue. As the linked list is sorted,
 the min-heap property is maintained.
